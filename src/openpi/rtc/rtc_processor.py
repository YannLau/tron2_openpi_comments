    Compatible with both Python ints and JAX traced values.
    Uses the same algorithm as the Kinetix reference implementation.

    With start=2, end=6, total=10, the output will be:

    `start` (inclusive) is where the chunk starts being allowed to change.
    `end` (exclusive) is where the chunk stops paying attention to the prefix.
    If start == 0, then the entire chunk is allowed to change.
    If end == total, then the entire prefix is attended to.
    `end` takes precedence over `start`: if end < start, start is pushed to end.
